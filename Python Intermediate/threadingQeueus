#Excellent for thread safe and process safe data exchanges
#Linear data structure that follow the fifo or First in First Out principle
#Example queue of customers waiting in line where customer that came first is also served first
from queue import Queue

# create queue
q = Queue() #create queue object

# add elements
q.put(1) # 1
q.put(2) # 2 1
q.put(3) # 3 2 1 one is beginning of queue

# now q looks like this:
# back --> 3 2 1 --> front

# get and remove first element
first = q.get() # --> 1 #queue not only has three and two inside
print(first) 

#check if queue is empty
#q.empty #returns true if queue is empty

#when done processing should call
# q.task_done() #tells program done processing and can continue
# q.join() #blocks until all items in queue have been gotten and processed . 

# q looks like this:
# back --> 3 2 --> front
